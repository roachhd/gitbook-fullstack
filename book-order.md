# Book layout: what order do things go? 

If you look at some of the books on your shelf, you’ll see some consistency as to how the internal layout is ordered. The Chicago Manual of Style also helps you step-by-step through this process and describes, in much detail, as to what each element is, such as a Foreword, Appendix, etc. Not every book will have a review page, appendixes, glossary, or even bibliography. Every book should have a title page, copyright page, and table of contents.

Here is a template for the order of sections in a typical book. 

- Title page: might include just the title and author; can include edition and publisher
- Copyright page: publishing information, ISBN, CIP, copyright holder, year…
- Reviews: may or may not be included in a book; this is where you commonly see them
- Dedication
- Table of contents
- Foreword
- Introduction
- Other front matter: might include map (such as in military planning), list of abbreviations, etc.
- Chapters
- Conclusion, Afterword, Epilogue
- Appendixes: explanations and/or elaborations of chapter material
- Chronology
- Endnotes
- Glossary
- Bibliography or references
- List of contributors
- Index

If a book is hardcover, then it is common to have the author information on the cover wrap. Otherwise, if a book is softcover, the author information might be on the back cover or inside, after the conclusion.
